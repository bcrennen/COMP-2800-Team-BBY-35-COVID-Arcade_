            <p>I’ve been fascinated by game design ever since my older brother introduced 
                me to Scratch when I was 8.  Since then the desire to design and develop 
                games has never subsided. Working together with my team members on this 
                project has been a dream come true for me.  It has forced me to script in 
                a way that makes it easier for my team members to read and in turn has made 
                me a better, more efficient coder.</p>

            <p>I have had a great time developing Covid Arcade with this team. 
                My goal is to become a Game Designer so It has been very beneficial 
                to my learning to have a project based around C# and Unity. Furthermore, 
                working on this project has improved my teamwork and time-management skills. 
                I’m glad to be working on a project that is so conscious of the pandemic 
                and am proud of what we have done and hope to do more.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, hope you are having a great time looking through our website, 
                Covid Arcade. This project was really fun and enjoyable working with Johnny, 
                Max and Lim. I do not have much experience in coding, but I will continue to
                make enjoyable web pages like this for everyone. My goal is to become a web 
                developer so the task I have done for this project would definitely help me 
                in the near future. Furthermore, this project has helped me to become a better 
                team player as well as management my time skill.</p>

            <p>I recently finished my first semester of computer system technology. And it 
                was fun to team up with Brennen, Max, and Johnny and to do a mini-game project 
                with the team members. For this project, I've been working on databases because 
                I'm interested in managing databases and cloud computing platforms. This kind of 
                work can help me improve my database skills. Furthermore, I can improve my time 
                management and teamwork, not only coding skills.</p>
